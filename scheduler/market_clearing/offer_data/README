Organization of offer directories (subject to change, of course):

offer_dir will hold a file with info on participants and resources.
Each participantID will be connected to its resource IDs. Each
resouce in the will have its type (gen, ren, str, dem, vir)

Each participant has their own directory. Name is something like
participant_[participantID]

Within their directories they have a unique directory for each 
storage resource in their portfolio, as well as a single virtual
bid directory (unless multiple virtual bid directories are needed).
These will each have the (pre-assigned) resource ID. The virtual
bid directory will be named vir_[participantID].

The resource directories will hold the offer data file (in .json
format) and the latest status updates from the system (also in
.json format). These will be the status updates unique to that
resource (current offers/settlements, state of charge, etc.)

This will look like
participant_[pID]
--str_[rID]
----offer_[rID]
----status_[rID]
--vir_[pID]
----offer_[pID]
----status_[pID]

Offers from all of the other resources will be pre-determined
by the contest operators. These are in the directory
fixed_system_resources. Each resource will have its own directory
within fixed_system_resources. Note that the offers may not be
static (renewables can shift MW offer up/down based on forecast,
thermal may change offer if a unit goes offline, etc.), but
they cannot be adjusted (or viewed) by participants.

This will look like
fixed_system_resources
--gen_[rID]
----offer_[rID]
----status_[rID]
(and so on for every resource)
